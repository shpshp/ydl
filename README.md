youtube-dl cmd convenience script, copyright 2017 (c) by Shp

The script downloads YouTube links from text files in different formats depending in which file it was written to (*720p.txt = best quality available, *360p.txt = middle quality, *mp3.txt = music only: ffmpeg is needed!).

Put some YouTube links into the text files (one link per line), run the script and enjoy!
